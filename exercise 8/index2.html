<div class="body">Sarah Cynthia Sylvia Stout<br>
<div class="bodybold">Would not take the garbage out.</div><br><br>
 She'd wash the dishes and scrub the pans.<br>
 Cook the yams and spice the hams,<br><bR>
 <div class="bodybold">And though her parents would scream and shout,<br></div>
 <div class="bodyboldbig">She simply would not take the garbage out.</div>
 <br><br>
<div class="body"><ol>And so it piled up to the ceiling:<br>
Coffee grounds,<br> potato peelings,<br>
Brown bananas<br> and rotten peas,<br>
Chunks of sour cottage cheese.</ol><br><br>
It filled the can,<br>
<div class="bodybold"> it covered the floor,</div>
 <div class="bodyboldbig">It cracked the windows and blocked the door,</div><br>
 <div class="body"><ol>With:<br> bacon rinds and chicken bones,<br>
Drippy ends of ice cream cones,<br>
Prune pits,<br> peach pits,<br> orange peels,<br>
Gloppy glumps of<br>cold oatmeal,<br>
Pizza crusts <br>and withered greens,<br>
Soggy beans,<br>and tangerines,<br>
Crusts of black-burned<br> buttered toast,<br>
Grisly bits of<br>beefy roast.</div></ol>
<div class="body2"><ol>The garbage rolled on down the halls,<br><div class="bodybold">
It raised the roof, it broke the walls,</div><br><br> I mean:<br>
greasy napkins,
<br> cookie crumbs,<br>
Blobs of gooey bubble gum,<br>
Cellophane from old bologna,<br>
Rubbery, blubbery macaroni,<br>
Peanut butter, caked and dry,<br>
Curdled milk,<br>and crusts of pie,<br>
Rotting melons,<br>dried-up mustard,<br>
Eggshells mixed with lemon custard,<br>
Cold French fries<br>and rancid meat,<br>
Yellow lumps of Cream of Wheat.<br></div></ol>
<br><br>
<div class="body">At last the garbage reached so high,<br>
<div class="bodybold">That finally it touched the sky,<div>
<div class="body">And none of her friends would come to play,
And all of her neighbors moved away;</div><br><br>
<div class="bodyboldbig">And finally, Sarah Cynthia Stout Said, "Okay, I'll take the garbage out!"</div><br><br>
<div class="body">But then, of course it was too late,
The garbage reached across the state, 
From New York to the Golden Gate;<br>
And there in the garbage she did hate
Poor Sarah met an awful fate
That I cannot right now relate
Because the hour is much too late<br><br>
<div class="bodybold">But children, remember Sarah Stout,</div>
<div class="bodyboldbig">And always take the garbage out. </div>
