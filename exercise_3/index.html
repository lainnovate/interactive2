Sarah Cynthia Sylvia Stout<br>

&nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 
Would not take the garbage out.<br>

&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
 She'd wash the dishes and scrub the pans<br>

&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
 Cook the yams and spice the hams,<br>

&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  And though her parents would scream and shout,<br>

&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She simply would not take the garbage out.<br>

&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp And so it piled up to the ceiling:<br>


&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
Coffee grounds, potato peelings,<br>


&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 
Brown bananas and rotten peas,<br>

&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
Chunks of sour cottage cheese.<br>

&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 
It filled the can, it covered the floor,<br>

&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
It cracked the windows and blocked the door,<br>

&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
With bacon rinds and chicken bones,<br>

&nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 
Drippy ends of ice cream cones,<br>

&nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp
Prune pits, peach pits, orange peels,<br>

&nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 
Gloppy glumps of cold oatmeal,<br>

&nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp
Pizza crusts and withered greens,<br>

&nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp 
Soggy beans, and tangerines, Crusts of black-burned buttered toast,<br>

&nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 
Grisly bits of beefy roast. The garbage rolled on down the halls,<br>

&nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 
It raised the roof, it broke the walls,
<br>
&nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
I mean, greasy napkins, cookie crumbs,<br>

&nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 
Blobs of gooey bubble gum, Cellophane from old bologna,<br>

&nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rubbery, blubbery macaroni, Peanut butter, caked and dry, Curdled milk, and crusts of pie,<br>

&nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 
Rotting melons, dried-up mustard, Eggshells mixed with lemon custard,<br>

&nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Cold French fries and rancid meat, Yellow lumps of Cream of Wheat.<br>

&nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 
At last the garbage reached so high, That finally it touched the sky,<br>

&nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 
And none of her friends would come to play, And all of her neighbors moved away;<br>

&nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp And finally, Sarah Cynthia Stout, Said, "Okay, I'll take the garbage out!"<br>

&nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp But then, of course it was too late, The garbage reached across the state, From New York to the Golden Gate;<br>

&nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp And there in the garbage she did hate, Poor Sarah met an awful fate, That I cannot right now relate<br>

&nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 
Because the hour is much too late, But children, remember Sarah Stout, And always take the garbage out.
