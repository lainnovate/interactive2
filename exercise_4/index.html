<h2>Sarah Cynthia Sylvia Stout</h2>
<h1>Would not take the garbage out.</h1>
She'd:
<ol> <h3>wash the dishes</h3>
and <h3>scrub the pans<br>
Cook the yams</h3>
and
<h3>spice the hams,</h3>

And though her parents would scream and shout,</ol>
<h1>She simply would not take the garbage out.</h1>

And so it piled up to the ceiling:
<ol>
<h3>Coffee grounds,<br>
potato peelings,<br>
Brown bananas and rotten peas,<br>
Chunks of sour cottage cheese.</h3></ol>

It filled the can, it covered the floor,<br>
It cracked the windows and blocked the door,<br>
With:
<ol>
	<h3>bacon rinds</h3><br>
	and
	<h3> chicken bones,<br>
Drippy ends of ice cream cones,<br>
Prune pits,<br>
peach pits,<br>
orange peels,<br>
Gloppy glumps of cold oatmeal,<br>
Pizza crusts<br></h3>
 and<br>
 <h3> withered greens,<br>
Soggy beans,<br></h3>
 and<br>
 <h3> tangerines,<br>
Crusts of black-burned buttered toast,<br>
Grisly bits of beefy roast.<br></h3></ol>

The garbage rolled on down the halls,<br>
It raised the roof, it broke the walls,<br>
I mean:<br>
<ol><h3>greasy napkins,<br>
cookie crumbs,<br>
Blobs of gooey bubble gum,<br>
Cellophane from old bologna,<br>
Rubbery, blubbery macaroni,<br>
Peanut butter, <em>caked and dry,</em><br>
Curdled milk,<br></h3>
 and<br>
 <h3> crusts of pie,<br>
Rotting melons,<br>
 dried-up mustard,<br>
Eggshells mixed with lemon custard,<br>
Cold French fries <br>
</h3>and<br>
<h3>rancid meat,<br>
Yellow lumps of Cream of Wheat.</h3></ol><br>
At last the garbage reached so high<br>
That finally it touched the sky,<br>
And none of her friends would come to play,<br>
And all of her neighbors moved away;<br><br>
<h2>And finally, Sarah Cynthia Stout
Said, "Okay, I'll take the garbage out!"</h2>

But then, of course it was too late,<br>
The garbage reached across the state,<br>
From New York to the Golden Gate;<br>
And there in the garbage she did hate<br><br>
Poor Sarah met an awful fate<br>
That I cannot right now relate<br>
Because the hour is much too late<br>
<h1><em>But children, remember Sarah Stout,
And <strong>always<strong> take the garbage out. </em></h1>
