<h1>Sarah Cynthia Sylvia Stout</h1>
<h1>Would not take the garbage out.</h1>
<h1>She'd wash the dishes and scrub the pans</h1>
<h1>Cook the yams and spice the hams,</h1>
<h1>And though her parents would scream and shout,</h1>
<h1>She simply would not take the garbage out.</h1>
<h1>And so it piled up to the ceiling:</h1>
<h1>Coffee grounds, potato peelings,</h1>
<h2>Brown bananas and rotten peas,</h2>
<h2>Chunks of sour cottage cheese.</h2>
<h2>It filled the can, it covered the floor,
<h2>It cracked the windows and blocked the door,</h2>
<h2>With bacon rinds and chicken bones,</h2>
<h2>Drippy ends of ice cream cones,</h2>
<h2>Prune pits, peach pits, orange peels,</h2>
<h2>Gloppy glumps of cold oatmeal,</h2>
<h3>Pizza crusts and withered greens,</h3>
<h3>Soggy beans, and tangerines,</h3>
<h3>Crusts of black-burned buttered toast,</h3>
<h3>Grisly bits of beefy roast.</h3>
<h3>The garbage rolled on down the halls,</h3>
<h3>It raised the roof, it broke the walls,</h3>
<h3>I mean, greasy napkins, cookie crumbs,</h3>
<h3>Blobs of gooey bubble gum,</h3>
<h3>Cellophane from old bologna,</h3>
<h4>Rubbery, blubbery macaroni,</h4>
<h4>Peanut butter, caked and dry,</h4>
<h4>Curdled milk, and crusts of pie,</h4>
<h4>Rotting melons, dried-up mustard,</h4>
<h4>Eggshells mixed with lemon custard,</h4>
<h4>Cold French fries and rancid meat,</h4>
<h5>Yellow lumps of Cream of Wheat.</h5>
<h5>At last the garbage reached so high</h5>
<h5>That finally it touched the sky,</h5>
<h5>And none of her friends would come to play,</h5>
<h5>And all of her neighbors moved away;</h5>
<h4>And finally, Sarah Cynthia Stout</h4>
<h4>Said, "Okay, I'll take the garbage out!"</h4>
<h3>But then, of course it was too late,</h3>
<h3>The garbage reached across the state,</h3>
<h3>From New York to the Golden Gate;</h3>
<h2>And there in the garbage she did hate</h2>
<h2>Poor Sarah met an awful fate</h2>
<h2>That I cannot right now relate</h2>
<h2>Because the hour is much too late</h2>
<h1>But children, remember Sarah Stout,</h1>
<h1>And always take the garbage out.</h1>
