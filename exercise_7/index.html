			<h1>Sarah<br>

			 Stout<br>
	Would not take the garbage out.</h1></div><h3>
<div class="body">She'd wash the dishes<br> and scrub the pans<br>
Cook the yams<br> and spice the hams,</div>
<div class="body">And though her parents would scream and shout,
She simply would not take the garbage out.</div>
<div class="body">And so it piled up to the ceiling:</div>
<div class="list">Coffee grounds, potato peelings,
Brown bananas and rotten peas,
Chunks of sour cottage cheese.</div>
<div class="body">It filled the can, it covered the floor,
It cracked the windows and blocked the door,</div>
<div class="bar"> </div>
<div class="list2">With bacon rinds and chicken bones,
Drippy ends of ice cream cones,
Prune pits, peach pits, orange peels,
Gloppy glumps of cold oatmeal,
Pizza crusts and withered greens,
Soggy beans, and tangerines,
Crusts of black-burned buttered toast,
Grisly bits of beefy roast.</div>
<div class="list3">
The garbage rolled on down the halls,
It raised the roof, it broke the walls,</div>
<div class="list2">I mean, greasy napkins, cookie crumbs,
Blobs of gooey bubble gum,
Cellophane from old bologna,
Rubbery, blubbery macaroni,
Peanut butter, caked and dry,
Curdled milk, and crusts of pie,
Rotting melons, dried-up mustard,
Eggshells mixed with lemon custard,
Cold French fries and rancid meat,
Yellow lumps of Cream of Wheat.</div>
<div class="bar"> </div>
<div class="list3">At last the garbage reached so high
That finally it touched the sky,
And none of her friends would come to play,
And all of her neighbors moved away;</div></h3>
<h1><div class="list3">And finally, Sarah Cynthia Stout</div>
<div class="list3">Said, "Okay, I'll take the garbage out!"</h1></div>
<h3><div class="list4">But then, of course it was too late,
The garbage reached across the state,
From New York to the Golden Gate;
And there in the garbage she did hate
Poor Sarah met an awful fate
That I cannot right now relate
Because the hour is much too late
But children, remember Sarah Stout,
And always take the garbage out. </div></h3>
