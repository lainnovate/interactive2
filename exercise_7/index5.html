Sarah Cynthia Sylvia Stout, <strong><br>
Would not take the garbage out.</strong><br>
She'd wash the dishes <br>and scrub the pans<strong><br>
Cook the yams and <br>spice the hams,</strong><br>
And though her parents<br> would scream and shout,<strong><br>
She simply would not<br> take the garbage out.</strong><br>
And so it piled up<br> to the ceiling:<strong><br>
Coffee grounds,<br> potato peelings,</strong><br>
Brown bananas <br>and rotten peas,<br>
Chunks of sour cottage cheese.<br>
It filled the can,<br> it covered the floor,<br>
It cracked the windows <br>and blocked the door,<br>
With bacon rinds <br>and chicken bones,<br>
Drippy ends of <br>ice cream cones,<br>
Prune pits, <br>peach pits, <br>orange peels,<br>
Gloppy glumps of <br>cold oatmeal,<br>
Pizza crusts <br>and withered greens,<br>
Soggy beans, <br>and tangerines,<br>
Crusts of black-burned <br>buttered toast,<br>
Grisly bits<br> of beefy roast.<br>
The garbage rolled <br>on down the halls,<br>
It raised the roof,<br> it broke the walls,<br>
I mean, greasy napkins,<br> cookie crumbs,<br>
Blobs of gooey bubble gum,<br>
Cellophane from old bologna,<br>
Rubbery, blubbery macaroni,<br>
Peanut butter, caked and dry,<br>
Curdled milk,<br> and crusts of pie,<br>
Rotting melons,<br> dried-up mustard,<br>
Eggshells mixed <br>with lemon custard,<br>
Cold French fries <br>and rancid meat,<br>
Yellow lumps of <br>Cream of Wheat.<br>
At last the garbage <br>reached so high<br>
That finally it <br>touched the sky,<br>
And none of her friends <br>would come to play,<br>
And all of her neighbors <br>moved away;<br>
And finally, Sarah Cynthia Stout<br>
Said, "Okay, I'll take the garbage out!"<br>
But then, of course<br> it was too late,<br>
The garbage reached<br> across the state,<br>
From New York to<br> the Golden Gate;<br>
And there in the garbage<br> she did hate<br>
Poor Sarah met an awful fate<br>
That I cannot right now relate<br>
Because the hour is much too late<br>
But children, remember Sarah Stout,</div>
