<div class="body">Sarah Cynthia Sylvia Stout
Would not take the garbage out.</div>
<div class="body2">She'd wash the dishes and scrub the pans
Cook the yams and spice the hams,</div>
<div class="body3">And though her parents would scream and shout,</div>
<div class="body2">She simply would not take the garbage out.</div>
<div class="body">And so it piled up to the ceiling:</div>
<div class="body2">Coffee grounds, potato peelings,<br>
Brown bananas and rotten peas,<br>
Chunks of sour cottage cheese.<br></div>
<div class="body3">It filled the can, it covered the floor,
It cracked the windows and blocked the door,</div>
<div class="body4">With bacon rinds and chicken bones,<br>
Drippy ends of ice cream cones,<br>
Prune pits, peach pits, orange peels,<br>
Gloppy glumps of<br>cold oatmeal,<br>
Pizza crusts and withered greens,<br>
Soggy beans,<br>and tangerines,<br>
Crusts of black-burned<br> buttered toast,<br>
Grisly bits of<br>beefy roast.</div>
<div class="body3">The garbage rolled on down the halls,
It raised the roof, it broke the walls,</div>
<div class="body2">I mean, greasy napkins, cookie crumbs,<br>
Blobs of gooey<br>bubble gum,<br>
Cellophane from<br>old bologna,<br>
Rubbery,<br> blubbery<br> macaroni,<br>
Peanut butter,<br>caked and dry,<br>
Curdled milk,<br>and crusts of pie,<br>
Rotting melons,<br>dried-up mustard,<br>
Eggshells mixed with<br>lemon custard,<br>
Cold French fries<br>and rancid meat,<br>
Yellow lumps of<br>Cream of Wheat.<br></div>
<div class="body">At last the garbage reached so high
That finally it touched the sky,
And none of her friends would come to play,
And all of her neighbors moved away;</div>
<div class="body2">And finally, Sarah Cynthia Stout
Said, "Okay, I'll take the garbage out!"</div>
<div class="body3">But then, of course it was too late,
The garbage reached across the state,
From New York to the Golden Gate;
And there in the garbage she did hate
Poor Sarah met an awful fate</div>
<div class="body4">That I cannot right now relate
Because the hour is much too late
But children, remember Sarah Stout,
And always take the garbage out. </div>
