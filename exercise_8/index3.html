<div class="body">Sarah<br> Cynthia<br> Sylvia<br> Stout<br>
Would not take<br> the garbage out.<br>
She'd wash the dishes<br> and scrub the pans<br>
Cook the yams <br>and spice the hams,<br>
And though her parents<br> would scream and shout,<br>
She simply would not<br> take the garbage out.<br>
And so it piled up<br> to the ceiling:<br>
Coffee grounds,<br> potato peelings,<br>
Brown bananas<br> and rotten peas,<br>
Chunks of <br>sour cottage cheese.<br>
It filled the can,<br> it covered the floor,
It cracked the windows<br>and blocked the door,<br>
With bacon rinds <br>and chicken bones,<br>
Drippy ends of <br>ice cream cones,<br>
Prune pits,<br> peach pits,<br> orange peels,<br>
Gloppy glumps of <br>cold oatmeal,<br>
Pizza crusts <br>and withered greens,<br>
Soggy beans, <br>and tangerines,<br>
Crusts of black-burned <br>buttered toast,<br>
Grisly bits of beefy roast.<br>
The garbage rolled <br>on down the halls,<br>
It raised the roof, <br>it broke the walls,<br>
I mean,<br> greasy napkins, <br>cookie crumbs,<br>
Blobs of gooey<br> bubble gum,<br>
Cellophane from<br> old bologna<br>,
Rubbery, blubbery macaroni,<br>
Peanut butter,<br> caked and dry,<br>
Curdled milk,<br> and crusts of pie,
Rotting melons, <br>dried-up mustard,
Eggshells mixed with lemon custard,<br>
Cold French fries <br>and rancid meat,
Yellow lumps of <br>Cream of Wheat.<br>
At last the garbage<br> reached so high<br>
That finally <br>it touched the sky,<br>
And none of her friends <br>would come to play,<br>
And all of her neighbors <br>moved away;<br>
And finally,<br> Sarah <br>Cynthia <br>Stout<br>
<strong>Said,<br> "Okay, I'll take the garbage out!"</strong>
But then, of course<br> it was too late,<br>
The garbage reached<br> across the state,<br>
From New York<br> to the Golden Gate;
And there in the garbage <br>she did hate<br>
Poor Sarah<br> met an awful fate<br>
That I cannot <br>right now relate<br>
Because the hour <br>is much too late<br>
But children,<br> remember Sarah Stout,<br>
And always take <br>the garbage out.
