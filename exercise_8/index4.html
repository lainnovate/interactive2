Poor Sarah met an awful fate, That I cannot right now relate, Because the hour is much too late, But children, remember Sarah Stout,And always take the garbage out. <br>
But then, of course it was too late, The garbage reached across the state,From New York to the Golden Gate; And there in the garbage she did hate<br>
<div class="huge">Said, "Okay, I'll take the garbage out!"</div>
And all of her neighbors moved away; And none of her friends would come to play, And all of her neighbors moved away; And finally, Sarah Cynthia Stout<br>
Cold French fries and rancid meat, Yellow lumps of Cream of Wheat. At last the garbage reached so high, That finally it touched the sky<br>
Rubbery, blubbery macaroni, Peanut butter, caked and dry, Curdled milk, and crusts of pie, Rotting melons, dried-up mustard,<br>
I mean, greasy napkins, cookie crumbs, Blobs of gooey bubble gum, Blobs of gooey bubble gum, Cellophane from old bologna,<br>
Grisly bits of beefy roast. The garbage rolled on down the halls, It raised the roof, it broke the walls,<br>
Pizza crusts and withered greens, Soggy beans, and tangerines, Crusts of black-burned buttered toast,<br>
Drippy ends of ice cream cones, prune pits, peach pits, orange peels, Gloppy glumps of cold oatmeal,<br>
It cracked the windows and blocked the door,With bacon rinds and chicken bones,<br>
Chunks of sour cottage cheese.It filled the can, it covered the floor,<br>
Coffee grounds, potato peelings, Brown bananas and rotten peas,<br>
not take the garbage out. And so it piled up to the ceiling:<br>
her parents would scream and shout,She simply would <br>
Cook the yams and spice the hams, And though <br>
She'd wash the dishes and scrub the pans<br>
Would not take the garbage out.<br>
Sarah Cynthia Sylvia Stout<br>
