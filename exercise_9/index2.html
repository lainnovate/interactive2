<div class="box1">
Sarah Cynthia Sylvia Stout
<div class="box2">
Would not take the garbage out.
<div class="box3">
	She'd wash the dishes and scrub the pans
<div class="box4">
	Cook the yams and spice the hams,
<div class="box3">
And though her parents would scream and shout,
<div class="box4">
She simply would not take the garbage out.
<div class="box1">
And so it piled up to the ceiling:
<div class="box2">
Coffee grounds, potato peelings,
<div class="box3">
Brown bananas and rotten peas,
<div class="box4">
Chunks of sour cottage cheese.
<div class="box1">
It filled the can, it covered the floor,
<div class="box2">
It cracked the windows
<div class="box3">
 and blocked the door,
<div class="box3">
With bacon rinds 
<div class="box4">
and chicken bones,
<div class="box2">
Drippy ends of ice cream cones,
<div class="box1">
Prune pits,
<div class="box4">
 peach pits,
 <div class="box3"> 
 	orange peels,
 	<div class="box2">
Gloppy glumps of cold oatmeal,
<div class="box4">
Pizza crusts
<div class="box1">
 and withered greens,
 <div class="box4">
Soggy beans,
<div class="box2">
 and tangerines,
 <div class="box3">
Crusts of black-burned buttered toast,
<div class="box1">
Grisly bits of beefy roast.
<div class="box4">
The garbage rolled on down the halls,
<div class="box2">
It raised the roof,
<div class="box3"> 
	it broke the walls,
	<div class="box4">
I mean, greasy napkins, 
<div class="box2">
cookie crumbs,
<div class="box1">
Blobs of gooey bubble gum,
<div class="box4">
Cellophane from old bologna,
<div class="box1">
Rubbery, blubbery macaroni,
<div class="box3">
Peanut butter, caked and dry,
<div class="box2">
Curdled milk,
<div class="box1">
 and crusts of pie,
 <div class="box4">
Rotting melons,
<div class="box1">
 dried-up mustard,
 <div class="box2">
Eggshells mixed with lemon custard,
<div class="box3">
Cold French fries
<div class="box1">
 and rancid meat,
 <div class="box4">
Yellow lumps of Cream of Wheat.
<div class="box3">
At last the garbage reached so high
<div class="box4">
That finally it touched the sky,
<div class="box1">
And none of her friends
<div class="box2"> 
	would come to play,
	<div class="box3">
And all of her neighbors moved away;
<div class="box4">
And finally, Sarah Cynthia Stout
<div class="box5">
Said, "Okay, I'll take the garbage out!"
But then, of course it was too late,
The garbage reached across the state,
From New York to the Golden Gate;
And there in the garbage she did hate
Poor Sarah met an awful fate
That I cannot right now relate
Because the hour is much too late
But children, remember Sarah Stout,
And always take the garbage out.
