<div class="innards box">Sarah Cynthia Sylvia Stout<br>Would not take the garbage out.<br>She'd wash the dishes<br> and scrub the pans<br>Cook the yams <br>and spice the hams,<br>
</div>
<div class="innards box">
And though her parents<br> would scream and shout,<br>
She simply would not<br> take the garbage out.<br></div>
<div class="innards box">
And so it piled up<br> to the ceiling:<br>
Coffee grounds,<br> potato peelings,<br>
Brown bananas<br> and rotten peas,<br>
Chunks of <br>sour cottage cheese.<br></div>
<div class="innards box">
It filled the can,<br> it covered the floor,
It cracked the windows and blocked the door,<br>
With bacon rinds and chicken bones,<br>
Drippy ends of ice cream cones,<br>
Prune pits, peach pits, orange peels,<br></div>
<div class="innards box">
Gloppy glumps of cold oatmeal,<br>
Pizza crusts and withered greens,<br>
Soggy beans, and tangerines,<br>
Crusts of black-burned<br>buttered toast,<br>
Grisly bits of beefy roast.<br></div>
<div class="innards box">
The garbage rolled on down the halls,<br>
It raised the roof, it broke the walls,<br>
I mean, greasy napkins,<br>cookie crumbs,<br>
Blobs of gooey bubble gum,<br>
Cellophane from old bologna<br>,
Rubbery, blubbery macaroni,<br></div>
<div class="innards box">
Peanut butter, caked and dry,<br>
Curdled milk, and crusts of pie,
Rotting melons, dried-up mustard,
Eggshells mixed with lemon custard,<br>
Cold French fries and rancid meat,
Yellow lumps of Cream of Wheat.<br></div>
<div class="innards box">
At last the garbage reached so high<br>
That finally it touched the sky,<br>
And none of her friends <br>would come to play,<br></div>
<div class="innards box">
And all of her neighbors moved away;<br>
And finally, Sarah Cynthia Stout<br>
<strong>Said, "Okay, I'll take the garbage out!"</div>
</strong><div class="innards box">
But then, of course it was too late,<br>
The garbage reached across the state,<br>
From New York to the Golden Gate;
And there in the garbage <br>she did hate<br>
Poor Sarah met an awful fate<br></div>
<div class="innards box">
That I cannot right now relate<br>
Because the hour is much too late<br>
But children, remember Sarah Stout,<br></div>
<div class=" out box">And always take the garbage out. </div>
