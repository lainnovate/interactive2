Sarah Cynthia Sylvia Stout,<br>
<div class="box1"></div>
<strong>Would not take the garbage out.</strong>
<div class="box1"></div>
She'd wash the dishes and scrub the pans. 
<div class="box2"></div>
Cook the yams and spice the hams,
<div class="box1"></div>
And though her parents would <strong>scream and shout,</strong>
<div class="box2"></div>
She simply would <strong>not</strong> take the garbage out.
<div class="box2"></div>
And so it piled up to the ceiling:
<div class="box2"></div>
Coffee grounds, potato peelings,
<div class="box3"></div>
Brown bananas and rotten peas,
<div class="box3"></div>
Chunks of sour cottage cheese.
<div class="box3"></div>
<strong>It filled the can, it covered the floor,
	<div class="box3"></div>
It cracked the windows and blocked the door,</strong>
<div class="box3"></div>
With bacon rinds and chicken bones,
<div class="box3"></div>
Drippy ends of ice cream cones,
<div class="box3"></div>
Prune pits, peach pits, orange peels,
<div class="box4"></div>
Gloppy glumps of cold oatmeal,
<div class="box4"></div>
Pizza crusts and withered greens,
<div class="box4"></div>
Soggy beans, and tangerines,
<div class="box5"></div>
Crusts of black-burned buttered toast,
<div class="box5"></div>
Grisly bits of beefy roast.
<div class="box5"></div>
<strong>The garbage rolled on down the halls,
	<div class="box5"></div>
It raised the roof, it broke the walls,</strong>
<div class="box6"></div>
I mean, greasy napkins, cookie crumbs,
<div class="box6"></div>
Blobs of gooey bubble gum,
<div class="box6"></div>
Cellophane from old bologna,
<div class="box6"></div>
Rubbery, blubbery macaroni,
<div class="box6"></div>
Peanut butter, caked and dry,
<div class="box7"></div>
Curdled milk, and crusts of pie,
<div class="box7"></div>
Rotting melons, dried-up mustard,
<div class="box7"></div>
Eggshells mixed with lemon custard,
<div class="box7"></div>
Cold French fries and rancid meat,
<div class="box8"></div>
Yellow lumps of Cream of Wheat.
<div class="box8"></div>
<strong>At last the garbage reached so high
	<div class="box8"></div>
That finally it touched the sky,</strong>
<div class="box8"></div>
And none of her friends would come to play,
<div class="box8"></div>
And all of her neighbors moved away;
<div class="box9"></div>
And finally, Sarah Cynthia Stout
<div class="box9"></div>
Said, <strong>Okay, I'll take the garbage out!"</strong><br>
<div class="box9"></div>
But then, of course it was too late,
<div class="box9"></div>
The garbage reached across the state,
<div class="box9"></div>
From New York to the Golden Gate;
<div class="box10"></div>
And there in the garbage she did hate
<div class="box10"></div>
<strong>Poor Sarah met an awful fate</strong>
<div class="box10"></div>
That I cannot right now relate
<div class="box10"></div>
Because the hour is much too late
<div class="box11"></div>
<strong>But children, remember <div class="big">Sarah Stout,
<div class="box11"></div>
And always take the garbage out. </strong></div>
<div class="end">;-P</div></body>
